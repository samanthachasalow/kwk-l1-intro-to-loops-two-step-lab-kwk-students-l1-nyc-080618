  loop do 
    
#   Create a variable called `steps` and set it equal to zero
# * Just below this variable, write a loop that does four things:
#   1. Increases the value of `steps` by 1
#   2. Outputs the value of `steps`
#   3. If the value of `steps` is divisible by 2 (remember how to use the `%`?),
# outputs 'Left', otherwise, it should output 'Right'
#   3. Sleeps for 0.5 seconds

  # Write a loop that fulfills all criteria from Part 3 of the README.md
